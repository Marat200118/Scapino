## Getting started

### The brief
Find a solution on how Scapino can inform young adults about, let them enjoy or connect with (their) modern
dance?

### "How might we?" question
How might we inform art students from 18 to 25 years old who are already interested in visual arts, but feel a lack of connection to modern ballet so that they recognise the modern ballet as a compelling form of art?
